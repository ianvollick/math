  <h1>Algebraic Manipulation Exercises 1</h1>
  <p>Please note that in the following examples the little dots mean "multiply". So this \(3 \cdot 2\) means the same as \(3 \times 2\) (which equals \(6\), of course).</p>
  <example>
  Example \(1\). Solve for \(y\).
  $$\begin{align}
  \frac{y}{3} & = 2\\
  \frac{y}{3}\cdot 3 & = 2 \cdot 3 & \text{(Multiply by \(3\))} \\
  y & = 6 & \text{(Simplify)}
  \end{align}$$
  </example>
  <example>
  Example \(2\). Solve for \(y\).
  $$\begin{align}
  \frac{4y}{5} & = 8 \\
  \frac{4y}{5} \cdot 5 & = 8 \cdot 5 & \text{(Multiply by \(5\))} \\
  4y & = 40 & \text{(Simplify)}\\
  4y \cdot \frac{1}{4} & = 40 \cdot \frac{1}{4} & \text{(Divide by \(4\))} \\
  \frac{4y}{4} & = \frac{40}{4} & \text{(Simplify)} \\
  y & = 10 & \text{(Simplify)}
  \end{align}$$
